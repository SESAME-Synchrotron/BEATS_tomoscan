Safety
======

At the start of your beamtime you will receive a general safety training from the SESAME safety office.

Radiation protection
--------------------

Radiation shielding assures the limitation of the exposure to ionizing radiation of all SESAME staff members and visitors to values legally defined by the Local Jordanian Law of Radiation Protection (Nuclear Safety and Security Law No. 43 for the year 2007 and its amendments).
The expected dose received by staff members and users must be less than the dose limit for the general public for 2000 working hours. This implies shielding measures limiting the dose rate to values below a maximum of 0.5 ÂµSv/h under normal operation conditions.

.. warning::
    It is strictly prohibited to move, open, make holes, or modify in any way the beamline radiation shielding (i.e. lead, tungsten, polyethylene panels).

Personnel Safety System (PSS)
-----------------------------

Personnel safety system (PSS) operates as an access control system for the shielded enclosed areas to prevent access to dangerous levels of radiation.


Hutch Search Procedure
----------------------

One of the main PSS procedures is the search of the hutches, with the purpose to make sure that all staff left before the x-ray beam is brought into the hutch. Only when the search is completed (all search buttons have been pressed, confirming that no person has been found in the respective area) and the searcher left the hutch, the beamline shutters can be opened.

.. note::
    The purpose of the search is to make sure that nobody is in the hutch when the x-ray beam enters it. During the search, all corners of the hutch must be inspected and search buttons pressed by the person performing the search. All doors must remain closed during this procedure.

To preform the search of the hutch:
    1. Do a pre-check to make sure that there are no people inside the hutch
    2. Close the hutch door
    3. Make sure that the safety officer and coordinators keys are in ON position, then press start search button. The red warning lights in the hutch will start blinking with variable tone audible warning to notify personnel that a search is in progress
    4. Open the door, go inside the hutch then close the door. If you or someone opened the door after this step and before finishing the search, the search will fail and you have to repeat the procedure
    5. Go to the first search point, look for people, if there are no people then press Search Button 1
    6. Go to the second search point, look for people, if there are no people then press Search Button 2.
    7. After searching the hutch and pressing all the buttons, leave the hutch and close the door. The door will be locked automatically
    8. Press finish search button. The audible warning changes to an intermittent tone before enabling the opening of the shutters

.. note::
    Note: The blinking frequency of the search buttons will change and become faster after a few seconds. It's at this time that you can press them.
