====================
Prepare for beamtime
====================

Travel and guesthouse arrangement
---------------------------------

`SESAME User Office <https://www.sesame.org.jo/for-users/sesame-user-office>`_ will be in contact with you to organize your visit, including guesthouse reservation, providing you with an access card, and coordinating your safety training. Read the points below before your visit. This will help you have a smooth start of your beamtime at BEATS.

Your stay at SESAME’s guesthouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please bring your soap/shampoo, and lotions. Towels are available in the guesthouse. **SESAME does not offer a cafeteria service at the moment, and there is no restaurant or café in the vicinity of the institute.** There are a few shops nearby that can be reached in a couple of minutes by car. We recommend you to bring food that you can cook at the guesthouse. You can also ask the taxi driver to stop at a supermarket on your way from the airport (this is generally included in the transportation cost).

Visualize and inspect your 3D data
----------------------------------

To use your beamtime efficiently, you must be able to inspect the recorded data. We expect you to know how to do basic operations in ImageJ! For instructions on how to install and use ImageJ see the section :ref:`Load reconstructed volume with ImageJ`. ImageJ is also a powerful tool for image processing and analysis of your datasets after the beamtime! If you need more tools, visit our list of 3D :ref:`Data analysis software`.

Bring enough storage
--------------------

Following `SESAME’s data policy <https://www.sesame.org.jo/for-users/user-guide/sesame-experimental-data-management-policy>`_, we will do our best to archive and maintain your data for at least 5 years after the experiment.

.. warning::
    Due to the massive size of tomography datasets, you will not be able to access data remotely after the beamtime. You are responsible for taking a copy of all data with you before leaving SESAME. For this, we ask you to bring external drive(s) with at least 4 TeraByte of free space.

Beamline essentials
-------------------

Please take a look at the following sections of the BEATS beamline manual to familiarize with the beamline operation. In particular, take a look at:

    * the :ref:`Hutch Search Procedure`, and at
    * the  :doc:`reconstruction` section.
