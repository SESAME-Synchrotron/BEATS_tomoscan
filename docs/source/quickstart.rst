Quick start guide
=================

Welcome to ID-10 BEATS. Follow the steps below to setup and perform your first scan.

.. note::
    The beamline is setup for your experiment at the start of the beamtime together with the beamline staff. Most of the times, there will be nothing to change from one scan to the next. Ask the beamline staff before changing any beamline setting.

The beamline control GUI allows to control the in-vacuum instrumentation in the beamline front-end, optics hutch, and experimental hutch.

Here are things users should be comfortable doing during their experiments.

In particular, you might need to adjust the configuration of:

* One or more of the beamline slits
* Attenuator system
* adjust the sample on the stage
* start a scan
