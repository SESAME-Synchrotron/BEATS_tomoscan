Tomoalign
=========

``Tomoalign`` is a python script that automates most tomography instrument alignemt taks. Tomoalign works in combination with a wire tungsten sample that needs to be installed on top of the rotary stage making sure is in the field of view at least when the rotation axis is at 0 and 180 degrees.

The ``tomoalign`` software and the contents of this section are kindly provided by the `TOMCAT beamline group <https://www.psi.ch/en/x-ray-tomography-group>`_ of the Swiss Light Source (`Paul Scherrer Institute <https://www.psi.ch/en/sls>`_, Switzerland).
