Quick CT reconstruction
=======================

Use the `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ pipeline at the link below for reconstructing and visualizing data collected at BEATS.
The notebook uses `TomoPy <https://tomopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, and is a good starting point for processing your data. You can make a copy of it, and modify the code based on your requirements.
