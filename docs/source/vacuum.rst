To open the beamline light path, the shutters must be opened in the following order:
    1. Radiation shutter.
    2. Photon shutter.
    3. Combined stopper.

.. note::
    It is only allowed to open the beamline shutters once the hutches have been searched. You will see a red button besides one of the shutter if opening is not allowed.

.. warning::
    Before opening the beamline shutters for the first time, verify with your local contact the setup of the beamline (slits, attenuator, ...).
