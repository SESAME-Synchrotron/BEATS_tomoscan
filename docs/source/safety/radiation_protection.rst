Radiation protection
--------------------

Radiation shielding assures the limitation of the exposure to ionizing radiation of all SESAME staff members and visitors to values legally defined by the Local Jordanian Law of Radiation Protection (Nuclear Safety and Security Law No. 43 for the year 2007 and its amendments).
The expected dose received by staff members and users must be less than the dose limit for the general public for 2000 working hours. This implies shielding measures limiting the dose rate to values below a maximum of 0.5 ÂµSv/h under normal operation conditions.

.. warning::
    It is strictly prohibited to move, open, make holes, or modify in any way the beamline radiation shielding (i.e. lead, tungsten, polyethylene panels).
