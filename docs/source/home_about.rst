The BEATS beamline is located at port I10 of the SESAME storage ring and operates a hard X-ray full-field radiography and micro Computed Tomography (CT) station. Hard x-ray imaging can be applied to numerous scientific areas.

The total lenght of the BEATS beamline is approximately 45 m. The insertion device is a 2.9 T Three-Pole Wiggler (E :sub:`crytical` = 12 kEv) that provides photon energies well above 80 keV. The beamline can be operated in two modalities: filtered white beam, and monochromatic beam using a Double Multilayer Monochromator (DMM).

The usable beam size at the sample position is 70 x 15 mm :sup:`2`, with estimated flux as high as 1×10 :sup:`10` Ph/s/mm :sup:`2` in 0.1% of the source bandwidth (white beam configuration). 

The beamline endstation is composed of a sample air-bearing tomography manipulator, and of indirect X-ray detectors coupled to sCMOS cameras. Object pixel sizes in the range from 13.0 μm down to 0.65 μm are achieved.

The BEATS project
-----------------

The European Horizon 2020 project BEAmline for Tomography at SESAME (BEATS) had the objective to design, procure, construct and commission a beamline for hard X-ray full-field tomography at the SESAME synchrotron in Jordan. The project was launched in January 2019 and completed in June 2023 with the inauguration of the beamline.

BEATS involved leading research facilities in the Middle East (SESAME and the Cyprus Institute), and European synchrotron radiation facilities ALBA-CELLS (Spain), DESY (Germany), the ESRF (France), Elettra (Italy), INFN (Italy), PSI (Switzerland), SESAME (Jordan) and SOLARIS (Poland).

The initiative was funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The project was coordinated by the ESRF.
