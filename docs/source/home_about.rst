The BEATS beamline is located at port I10 of the SESAME storage ring and operates a hard X-ray full-field radiography and micro Computed Tomography (CT) station. Hard x-ray imaging can be applied to numerous scientific areas.

The total length of the BEATS beamline is 45.3 m. The insertion device is a 2.9 T 3-Pole Wiggler (E :sub:`crytical` = 12 keV) that provides photon energies well above 80 keV. The beamline can be operated in two modalities: filtered white beam, and monochromatic beam using a Double Multilayer Monochromator (DMM).

The usable beam size at the sample position is 70 x 15 mm :sup:`2`, with estimated flux as high as 1×10 :sup:`10` Ph/s/mm :sup:`2` in 0.1% of the source bandwidth (white beam configuration). 

The beamline endstation is composed of a sample air-bearing tomography manipulator, and of indirect X-ray detectors coupled to sCMOS cameras. Object pixel sizes in the range from 13.0 μm down to 0.65 μm are achieved.
