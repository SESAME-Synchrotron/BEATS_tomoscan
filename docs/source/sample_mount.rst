Setup your experiment
=====================

	*Figure 1: BEATS experimental station. A pair of laser lines is used to pre-align sample and detector on the beam.*

1. Mount your sample on top of endstation #1
2. Turn on the alignment lasers
3. Use the laptop close to the endstation to:
	1. Pre-align sample on the intersection of the laser planes (you can verify this also moving the ROT stage)
	2. Pre-align the detector scintillator on the same line
	3. Set the distance between sample and detector to the desired value

.. warning::
	**Collision danger**: Only perform this operation together with the beamline staff. You must always pay attention to the position of endstation, detectors and sample, while performing the alignment. Always move small steps when you are close to the detector!!
