Setup your experiment
=====================

.. warning::
	**Collision danger**: Only perform this operation together with the beamline staff. You must always pay attention to the position of endstation, detectors and sample, while performing the alignment. **Always move small steps when endstation and detector are close to each other!**

	*Figure 1: BEATS experimental station. Two laser lines are used to pre-align sample and detector on the beam.*

Prepare your experiment following these steps:

#. Mount your sample on top of the tomography endstation (Figure 1 RIGHT)
#. Turn on the alignment lasers
#. Use the laptop close to the endstation to:

   #. Pre-align sample on the intersection of the laser planes (you can verify this also moving the ROT stage)
   #. Pre-align the detector scintillator on the same line
   #. Set the distance between sample and detector to the desired value
