Tomographic reconstruction at BEATS
===================================

This section contains examples of tomographic reconstruction pipelines using `TomoPy <https://tomopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

.. Examples can be run in your browser using the Binder link at the top of the page.

.. note::
    Reconstruction pipelines at BEATS can be also executed from the command line, or as `Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_ jobs on ``Rum@sesame.org.jo``.
    The header of each example shows the shell command to launch the pipeline as a script.
    Visit the page :doc:`computing` for more information.
