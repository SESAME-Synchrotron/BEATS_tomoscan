This is the documentation for the BEATS dashboard, which manages the BEATS IOCs and initiates scanning based on the camera type and scanning methodology (step and continuous scan).The tool has been developed by data collection and analysis team of SESAME in collaboration with control team.

This documentation is targeting scientists and developers.

The dashboard is GUI based which enables users to quickly choose the scanning parameters, and thus saving the time of explaining how to get BEATS experimental data.
