The BEATS project
-----------------

The European Horizon 2020 project BEAmline for Tomography at SESAME (BEATS) had the objective to design, procure, construct and commission a beamline for hard X-ray full-field tomography at the SESAME synchrotron in Jordan. The project was launched in January 2019 and completed in June 2023 with the inauguration of the beamline.

BEATS involved leading research facilities in the Middle East (SESAME and the Cyprus Institute), and European synchrotron radiation facilities ALBA-CELLS (Spain), DESY (Germany), the ESRF (France), Elettra (Italy), INFN (Italy), PSI (Switzerland), SESAME (Jordan) and SOLARIS (Poland).

The initiative was funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The project was coordinated by the ESRF.
